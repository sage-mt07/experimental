# error-handling (consolidated)

This will unify Retry, OnError, and DLQ into a single sample that lets you switch between them.
The former targets for consolidation are:
- `examples/error-handling`
- `examples/error-handling-dlq`

For now, refer to the legacy projects; code will migrate here over time.
