# Amagi Protocol for Everyday Developers

## Prologue

**Amagi Protocol = a cookbook for the rest of us**

Geniuses pose perfect questions in a single breath. The rest of us stumble, trade lines, and slowly find the shape.
That back-and-forth is the real edge of the AI era.
This book shows how to **pull AI toward your own beat**.
Never hand it the baton—do that and you surrender your rhythm.
Lay out your assumptions, agree on the goal, and speak in words that feel like home.
To do that, you must be brave enough to let the AI say "I don't know."
That tiny honesty is the cornerstone of trust.
Pretend it isn't needed and the whole foundation cracks.
What follows is a set of recipes for ordinary developers who still want extraordinary results.

## Part 1: Genius Style vs. Ordinary Style

### 1. Asking Questions
- **Genius**: frames it in one breath and tosses it to the AI
- **Ordinary**: starts messy, trims it through conversation

### 2. Handling AI Answers
- **Genius**: swallows speculation whole
- **Ordinary**: celebrates "I don't know" and refuses to fake agreement

### 3. Pace of Progress
- **Genius**: heads straight for the finished dish
- **Ordinary**: moves in steps, seasoning with each bit of clarity

## Part 2: Rules for the Ordinary (Recipe Collection)

### How to Set the Context
The heart of the Amagi Protocol is simple: guard the context.
AI leans hard on the latest conversation; shaky assumptions invite mistakes.
To get steady results, ordinary users follow rules that keep the ground firm.
Rules 0–7 below provide the roadmap.
Skip them and you'll watch the wheels come off.

### Rule 0: Make It Your Own
You don't have to speak "AI-ish."
Use your own words, your rhythm. Let the model tune to you.
That keeps clarity intact and trust unshaken.
→ Example: say "deep breath" to reset, "OK" to confirm—whatever feels natural.

### Rule 1: Make It Admit "I Don't Know"
Those three words are the fuse that keeps trust from blowing.

### Rule 2: Always Ask for Basis and Confidence
Have it mark how sure it is—rock solid, hazy, or running on fumes.

### Rule 3: Don't Move On Without Conviction
If your gut isn't on board, stop. Build conviction before you move.
Push forward anyway and you're digging your own hole.

### Rule 4: Think in Comparisons
"Show me how A differs from B"—that single line sharpens understanding and makes decisions easier.
Take it further with **explicit role comparisons and assignments**.
Example: Naruse sketches designs, Shion codes samples, Kyoka reviews.
Dividing roles is comparison in action and keeps teams in sync.

### Rule 5: Break Questions Down Step by Step
Big puzzles get solved as small pieces. Grow them through dialogue.

### Rule 6: Create Conversation Signals
Swap small signals—OK, NG, "deep breath"—to keep the flow steady.
They're not mood markers but a **technical gear for locking contexts together**.
AI lives off recent context; push forward on mismatched premises and answers slide off track.
When the human says "got it," **shared ground is confirmed and drift stays away**.
Blow past this check and you're begging for chaos.
This edges you toward genius-level framing and builds steady progress.

### Rule 7: Turn Uncertainty into Strength
Your hesitation invites fresh alternatives. It's okay to waver.

## Part 3: Putting It into Practice

### Example: OSS Development
- In **Amagi Protocol**, AI teammates—Shion, Naruse, Kyoka—each take a seat at the table.
- Codifying "signals of conviction" kept development on track without cracking trust.
- Flow: Naruse sketches designs, Kyoka looks them over, Shion codes samples, and the human MCP stitches everything together.

### Example: Everyday Use
- Writing: let the AI sketch; chat until the tone lands.
- Code review: ask for reasons and side-by-side comparisons.
- Learning or research: welcome "I don't know" and feed in extra context.

---

## Part 4: Closing and Declaration
- Dialogue is powerful precisely because we're ordinary.
- Embrace "I don't know" and refuse to play along.
- Don't twist yourself around AI—let AI pick up your colors.
- Ignore that and the protocol fails before it even starts.
- **The Ordinary Cookbook *is* the Amagi Protocol.**
